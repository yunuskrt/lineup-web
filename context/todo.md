# Lineup — Build Phases

Three repositories, built in order: **web → backend → mobile.**

Phase IDs are prefixed by repo (`W`, `B`, `M`). Line order is build order within a part; the current phase is the first `- [ ]` line in the file. When a repo is created, copy its part into that repo's own `context/todo.md`.

Workflow per phase: `/todo spec` → `/feature load <spec>` → `/feature start` → `/feature test` → `/feature complete`.

This todo file is for developer-side use. It is also only generated for the web application.

**Cross-repo dependencies** are marked `→ needs <ID>`. Phases W01–W26 have none: the entire web app is built against a mock API adapter before the backend exists. W27 onward is the wiring, and cannot start until the named backend phases are done.

## Part 1 — Web (Next.js)

- [x] **Phase W01 — Repo & Scaffold**: Next.js App Router, strict TS, eslint and prettier, `@/` alias.
- [x] **Phase W02 — Tokens & Types**: Local tokens file from `theme.md`, plus base domain types and schemas.

- [x] **Phase W04 — Theme Preview Route**: Internal `/dev/theme` rendering palette, type scale and spacing.
- [x] **Phase W05 — API Client Interface**: Typed contract for auth, solo, duel and profile, no implementation.
- [x] **Phase W06 — Mock API Adapter**: In-memory implementation of that interface, selected by env flag.
- [x] **Phase W07 — Mock Fixtures**: Hand-built matches, starting XIs, players and alias sets.
- [ ] **Phase W08 — App Shell & Layout**: Nav and footer per route; game routes carry no chrome, quit chip only.
- [ ] **Phase W09 — Pitch & Squad Grid**: CSS/SVG pitch with 11 outlined slots in formation, no raster assets.
- [ ] **Phase W10 — Countdown Ring**: 64px tabular numeral, linear sweep, three-stage colour escalation.

- [ ] **Phase W25 — System States**: Protocol refused, empty filter pool, rate limited and connection lost.
- [ ] **Phase W26 — Motion & A11y Pass**: Per-component reduced motion, focus order and contrast checks.
- [ ] **Phase W27 — Real API Client**: Point the client at NestJS; env config and credentialed requests. → needs B14
- [ ] **Phase W28 — Auth Wiring**: Real Better Auth session, guest identity and the upgrade flow. → needs B13

## Prerequisite

- [ ] **Phase P01 — Data Provider Trial**: Validate lineup coverage on 20 matches from 2001, 2006, 2011, 2019.

Not blocking the web build, but it must resolve before **B20 (Lineup Ingest)** — its answer decides whether the 2000–2026 season range in the spec is honest, or whether the 2000s ship later as a curated Classics pack.
